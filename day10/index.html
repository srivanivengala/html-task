        <h2><font bgcolor:"darkblue">Asset Management</font></h2>
       <p>Fincorp's Asset Management Division is one of the market leaders both in terms of size of assets under management and performance. This division is led by a young and dynamic team with a strong professional investment background and an average work experience of over 7 years in the financial services industry. (As on May 2009, the Assets Under Management was in excess of RO 50 million (US $ 125 million)).
           </p>
       <p> Our goal is to deliver long-term, consistent results for clients through our integrated investment platforms.
        </p>
    
      
       <b>Performance</b>
        
        <p>The Asset Management Division manages two open-ended listed funds namely
           </p>    
           1. Al Amal Fund JIA
        <p>as well as the flagship product which is the Discretionary Portfolio Management Services.
        </p>
        Fincorp is amongst the market leaders managing large Assets Under Management apart from being the leaders in performance of the funds under its management.
        
        <p>The performance of all the products have been widely acknowledged in the industry and amongst our valued and prestigious clientele. Despite the steep market downturn and volatility, we are proud to mention that the funds have outperformed the benchmark indices by a huge margin without sacrificing the quality of the portfolio and the liquidity quotient.
        </p>
       <b> Investment Process and Philosophy</b>
        
        <p>Fincorp utilises a very disciplined process of investment, starting from effective Fund Management to strict Compliance, Back Office systems and efficient Client Servicing. Our aim has always been to provide the client with superior returns against low levels of volatility, taking into consideration the risks of the economy and market liquidity as seen in the MSX.
        </p>
        Our philosophy of investment is based on a bottom-up stock picking methodology. However, given the strong macro relationship with the corporate bottom line, we use a blended matrix of both macro top-down and individual bottom-up stock picking methodologies.
        
        <p>Our investment philosophy is therefore flexible to meet the changes and challenges of this market.
        </p>
        <p>However, we never compromise on stock liquidity and fundamentals of the company before allocation. Trading is used only in a minor way to provide excess returns but never as a major strategy. Therefore, our clients make more than normal returns on stock allocation and lower churning (low brokerage).
        </p>
        <b> AMD Research</b>
        <p>       
        AMD has created its own Research, which is utilised on a proprietary basis for all funds managed by FINCORP. The same is accessible only by its fund managers & not by any other client. The quality of its proprietary research is visible in its fund performance.
        </p>
        <b>AMD Team Profile</b>
        
        <p>Fincorp has an extremely talented and professional team in its asset management division and its success can be attributed to strong processes and discipline practiced across. Aside from working independently, the team is guided by an Investment Committee, which takes pride in having some of the most experienced professionals in the field of investments.
