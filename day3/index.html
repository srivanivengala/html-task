and Jessore, Tagore wrote poetry as an eight-year-old.[13] At the age of sixteen,
 he released 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhanusimha_Thakurer_Padabali" target="_blank">
his first substantial poems </a>
under the pseudonym Bhānusiṃha ("Sun Lion"),
 which were seized upon by literary authorities as long-lost classics.[14] By 1877 he
 graduated to his first short stories and dramas, published under his real name.

<p>Tagore modernised Bengali art by spurning rigid classical forms and resisting 
linguistic strictures. His novels, stories, songs, dance dramas, and essays 
spoke to topics political and personal. Gitanjali (Song Offerings), Gora (Fair-Faced) 
and Ghare-Baire 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_and_the_World">(The Home and the World)
</a> are his best-known works, and his verse, 
short stories, and novels were acclaimed—or panned—for their lyricism, colloquialism, 
naturalism, and unnatural contemplation. His compositions were chosen by two nations
 as national anthems: India's 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jana_Gana_Mana">"Jana Gana Mana"</a>
 and Bangladesh's 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amar_Sonar_Bangla">"Amar Shonar Bangla".</a>

The
